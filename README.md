Public bike rental schemes have been launched in many cities around Europe, including successful networks in Irish towns and cities such as Dublin, Cork, and Galway. These provide local active transport links for commuting and leisure. This project explores the publically available data pertaining to the Dublin bike network, makes comparisons to the London network run by Santander, and makes recommendations on network adjustments that could be made to improve the network.
